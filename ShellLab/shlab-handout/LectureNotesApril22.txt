V tag 012....B-1 
V is valid bit o12....B-1 B=2^b bytes per chache block

if V is 0 then it is a miss 
if it is set to 1 then you must go to the offset and get that particular data is tag is matching it is a tes it is a hit then the block offset 


Direct-Mapped Chache Simulation
2^x=16
ln2^x=ln16
x=ln16/ln2
x=ln16-2
x=4


S=2^2 -> C1=2 bit 
B=2^b -> CO = 1 bit
E=2^t -> Ct = 1 bit

S=2^4
B=2

what are the different misses this will be on the exam

write through means you directly write data to RAM
And Write Back means you write data once evicted
